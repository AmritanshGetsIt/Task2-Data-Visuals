# Task2-Data-Visuals
Created data visuals from the dataset using Power Bi.

1. Understanding the Data and Story
Identify the purpose: What is the key message or insight you want to convey?
Understand the audience: Is this for executives, analysts, or a general audience?
Explore the dataset: Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

2. Choosing the Right Visuals
Bar Charts: Great for comparisons (e.g., Sales by Region).
Line Charts: Best for trends over time (e.g., Monthly Revenue Growth).
Pie Charts: Only use for part-to-whole relationships.
Heatmaps: Useful for showing density or intensity (e.g., Customer Churn by Region).
Scatter Plots: Best for correlations (e.g., Advertising Spend vs. Sales).

3. Designing an Effective Dashboard
Keep it clean and intuitive: Limit the number of colors and avoid clutter.
Use color strategically: Highlight key insights with contrast.
Add tooltips and filters: Allow interactive exploration.

4. Providing Context and Insights
Title and subtitles: Clearly state what each chart represents.
Annotations: Highlight key takeaways directly on the visuals.
Insights panel: Summarize key findings in a dedicated section.

5. Deliverables
Power BI / Tableau Dashboard: Export key visuals as screenshots.
Summary Slide/Storyboard: A one-page summary highlighting insights.
PDF Report: Combine dashboard screenshots with a brief narrative.
